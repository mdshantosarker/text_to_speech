		<h1>The Hare With Many Friends</h1>

		<p>A hare was very popular with the other beasts who all claimed to be her friends.Introduction:
The sister walks in while he's taking a shower
John was taking a shower after he got home from work when he heard the bathroom door open. He tried to look through the frosted glass of the shower doors when the shampoo ran down his face and got into his eyes. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly as he kept rinsing his face in an attempt to rinse the soap out of his eyes and tear ducts.

“Damn, that stings,” John said aloud.

He turned the water off and opened the shower door and keeping his eyes squeezed shut tightly as he blindly reached for the towel rack searching for his towel. His hand felt along the wall unable to find his towel.

“Your towel fell on the floor; it’s to your right.”

He recognized his younger sister’s voice. What was she doing in the bathroom while he showered?

John bent down and searched to his right and found the towel. He stood up and pulled the towel up to his face and dabbed his face and his eyes and then opened his stinging and watering eyes to see his sister sitting calmly on the closed toilet seat lid watching him.

“Ah sis... I’m naked here.”

“Yeah, I can definitely see that,” his sister replied grinning.

Karen made no move to leave. Her eyes traveled appraisingly up and down her brother’s dripping physique.

“Is there something that I can do for you Karen?”

“You’re actually doing it.”

“What am I doing... what are you doing in here?

“I’ve never seen a naked guy before. Well not in person, I’ve seen pictures and videos on the internet but I’ve never actually seen a naked guy before. Seeing naked guys in person is a lot more impressive than seeing them on a flat screen.”

“I think you might be too young sis to be worried about looking at naked guys.”

“Too young? Most of the girls that I know say that they have already seen naked guys... some claim to have even seen their erections. Several girls claimed to have even touched a guy’s hardon. A couple of the more adventurous ones have told stories claiming that they have gone a lot further than just looking and touching a guy’s erection too.”

“Do you believe them?” John said as he stood there dripping water while holding the towel in front of his genitals. It came as a complete surprised to John that his younger sister was interested in seeing him naked. He wondered how far her curiosity about naked guys would allow her to go.

“Janet said that I could go to her house if I wanted to see a naked guy. Apparently her brother parades around the house naked all the time. He stays naked even when she’s there and even when she brings her friends over too. She says that he will even let her and her friends watch him jacking off if they show him their tits while he does it.”

“Are you going to take her up on her invitation and go over there and watch her brother jack off?”

“I told Janet that I don’t think that I’d want to watch HER brother jacking off, or even see him naked. I’d much rather see you naked then her fat slob of a brother. Janet agreed with me, she said that she would prefer to see you naked also.”

His sister’s desire to see a naked guy surprised John. He took it as a compliment that her and her girlfriend wanted to see him naked. His curiosity was peeked. Was his sister telling him about Janet’s brother letting girls watch him masturbate because she’s hinting that she’d wanted to watch him jacking off?

“So you came in here just so you can see me naked?”

“I could only think of one guy I wanted to see naked. You don’t really mind if I check out your bod, do you? You always said that I could ask you anything about sex and you’d tell me the truth.”

“I don’t remember you asking me about letting you see me naked,” John laughed.

“I figured that if I’d asked you if I could see you naked, I’m pretty sure that you would’ve said yes. So I came in here to ask you if you would let me see you naked,” Karen grinned back at her brother.

“That’s a circuitous argument sis,” John laughed, “but I’ll let you get away with it this time because But one day she heard the hounds approaching and hoped to escape them by the aid of her many friends. So she went to the horse, and asked him to carry her away from the hounds on his back.</p>
		<p>But he declined, stating that he had important work to do for his master. “He felt sure,” he said, “that all her other friends would come to her assistance.” She then applied to the bull, and hoped that he would repel the hounds with his horns. The bull replied: “I am very sorry, but I have an appointment with a lady; but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what you want.” </p>
		<p>The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some harm if he took her upon it. The ram, he felt sure, was the proper friend to apply to. So she went to the ram and told him the case. </p>
		<p>The ram replied: “Another time, my dear friend. I do not like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been known to eat sheep as well as hares.” The Hare then applied, as a last hope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help her, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself, as so many older persons than himself had declined the task. By this time the hounds were quite near, and the Hare took to her heels and luckily escaped.</p>
